If you do not know how to code but want to learn and have fun, we have workshops and activities throughout the event for you to attend. We know that hackathons can be intimidating for many first-time hackers, and so we want this to be a learning and fun experience for you to become more comfortable with working with others, developing new skills, and letting your creativity shine under a time constraint."
