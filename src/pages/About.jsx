        HopperHacks X: 2025 will be the 10th annual hackathon of
        Women in Computer Science (WiCS) at Stony Brook University!<br/><br/>
        WiCS's mission is to provide encouragement
        and support to women in the field of
        computing. Hosting HopperHacks is one of the
        biggest ways we take part in that by providing
        students a place to gather and learn for a
        weekend full of innovation and creativity.</p>
